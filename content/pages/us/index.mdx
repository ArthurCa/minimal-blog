A North American SEO specialist is someone who is experienced in optimizing websites for search engines in the North American market (the USA, Canada, Mexico, ...). He (in my case he) or she will know how to research and select the most effective keywords for a website, and will also be able to optimize the website's on-page and off-page elements to improve its search engine rankings.

A North American SEO specialist will also be familiar with the different types of search engines used in the region (mostly Google and Bing in our case) and will be able to tailor his optimization strategies accordingly.
