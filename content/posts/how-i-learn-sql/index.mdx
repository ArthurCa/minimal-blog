A little bit different from my posts about learning Python and how I learned R.

This is kind of the third article I am publishing about "How I learned" stuff and especially ["Data languages"](/tags/data)

## The story behind the learning

The story behind the "Why did I learn SQL" is kind of funny: at the time still working as a Data Analyst in Luxembourg, I was creating reports with Power BI and we were building out data platform, so I took my chance and participated.

I knew very little about engineering or coding languages ... but I was curious and eagger to learn.

Following that I learn the "simple" 

```sql
SELECT *
FROM data_base_name
LIMIT 10
```

## The second real article about SQL

This is my second artcile about SQL on this blog, the first one was SQL 101 where I added some useful tips I learned along the way working with SQL. Yes, my SQL 101 is simple, but it's a intorduction and some tips ðŸ˜‡

## SQL is used everywhere

I am not joking, I realised that using SQL helped me better understand lots of things and I could use what I learned on a lot of things:

* Inside the `QUERY()` formula of Google Spreadsheet
* Connecting Google Big Query to Google Spreadsheet
* Behing able to look at data by myself and dig a little bit
* Doing quick analysis, extractions & table to present to people
