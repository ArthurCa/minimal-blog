I put myself in a "strange" position, no I am kidding: it's not a strange position or something I do not want to! The story begins when I was trying to be better with Github, learn new things ... and I am curious so I wanted to test new Internet things. And here we are: I am using Gatsby for my English SEO blog.

## Why a new blog?

I already have a tech / [SEO](/tags/seo) / [Data](/tags/data) blog, but it was in French ... and based on this statement it was limited to people reading, understand and/or speaking french. Also I am now working fully in English, so that made sense! Learn about me!

This blog will help me better figure out how to leverage things in Englsih and become [a better SEO Expert](/seo-expert-what-is-it) (sho knows)

> This post is a WIP and will be updated on a regular basis!
