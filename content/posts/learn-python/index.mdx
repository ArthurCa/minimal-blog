## [Funny part] Learn Python with Github Copilot

This sentence is coming from a podcast on frictionlog.com: is it possible to learn python just by follwing GitHub Copilot.

In fact Github Copilot is a great tool, to help you but not to learn something in my opinion. Why? Because of two examples (among others), (1) if you are using Github Copilot without any reflexion, you will not learn (except how to use your `Tab` key ðŸ˜‡), (2) most of the time, GitHub Copilot creates are "too simple" `df` / `df_2` / `df_df` /...
