It's not the first time I am writting about headers on the blog ([_HTML Display of a web-page_](/html-display-of-a-web-page)), and this time it is for a small tip about headers in Gatsby CMS.

## Non-technical blog posted

This blog post will not be technical ... unless pushing your blog updates thanks to git and using headless CMS is technical.

Yes, yes, I am playing on words _tomatoes_ Vs. _tomatoes_ and yes it's a little bit technical, but if you are here (), it's because you -- at least -- got a little interest for technical stuff.

## How to do your headers with Gastby CMS?

This is my tip, and it might change depending on your theme and you server. What I use is:

```markdown
---
title: {title-tag}
date: {YYYY-MM-DD}
description: "{meta-tag}"
tags:
  - {tag1}
  - {tag2}
banner: ./{banner}.jpg
---
```

Usually this header are a great addition to the existing what markdown is created and displayed. In my case this is the header for all my articles (under `index.md` file); where `{}` are standing for variables.
