## Context about the 410

Let's start with some context about the 410 and after that I will give you some examples on how to do this directly in Wordpress.

### What's 410?

410 is an HTTP answer, if you aren't familiar with it let's simplify by saying: "if a page is display it's a 200 & if a page is not displaying it's a 404".

> Yes I definitely took shortcuts here & on purpose!

### What does it stands for?

410 stands for _Gone_, the main goal of this HTTP answer is to remove an URL from your website (and inform both browser & search engine that you did that).

In SEO it is mainly used for removing URL from the index, saying to Google -- and its bots -- this longer is no longer available; all of this without needed to redirect it.

## How to do a 410 on Wordpress?

### 410 on your `.htaccess` file

To use & push a 410 on your website from the `.htaccess` file, you will have add a row in your file and do `Redirect` + either `gone` or `410` + your URL (`/url-of-your-website`)

```
Redirect gone /url-of-your-website
```

Or you can use `410` directly instead of `gone`

```
Redirect 410 /url-of-your-website
```

You can definitely do that for a lot of URLs, you will have to duplicate the example above and change the `/url-of-your-website`

### 410 thanks to the Redirect plugin

This _Redirect_ plugin is one of the most used in Wordpress to deal with different redirect codes; but did you know you could also used it for 4xx codes as 404 and 410. The later will be the center of our interest in this paragraph.

For that, you will have to go to `Tools` > `Redirection`; then add a `Source URL`, plus click on wheel, and then go into `Error (404)` from the menu `When matched`. From there you can select `410 - Gone` from the `with HTTP code` menu.

It's tricky because you think you will use a 404, so an error, but in fact it will be a 410, to remove the URL from the Index

> FYI: This plugin is using the `REST API` from Wordpress

### 410 thanks to the Rank Math plugin

It will be as easy as adding a 410 thanks to _Redirection_: Go into `Rank Math`, and then `Redirections`, from there you can select `Add New`, and under `Maintenance Code` click on the `410 Content Deleted` after adding the `/url-of-your-website` you would like to remove from the index.
