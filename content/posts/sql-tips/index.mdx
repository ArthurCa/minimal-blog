I don't have the pretention to know everything about SQL. But even if I don't know the inside and out of this language, I will bring you alongside me for some tips. So in this article I'll share a few tips I've gotten from my experience working with SQL.

</p>

My goal tis to give you a few tips to make SQL easy and usable. Hoping that will make it quick and easy to get the hang of SQL queries for you.

## Distinct

`DISTINCT` is really cool if you are looking for filter a specific table based on a value. For example you could use `DISTINCT` to display all domains in your table and after filtering it with `WHERE`.

(1)
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT colonne1, colonne2
FROM {table_name}
```

(2)
```sql
SELECT colonne1, colonne2
FROM FROM {table_name}
WHERE colonne2 = {unique_value}
```

> You can find it close to the `=UNIQUE()` formula in Google Spreadsheet or `.unique` in Python with `pandas` 

## Limit

This is one of my favorite to use: it's easy, simple and so efficient! What all 3 of that? Why using `LIMIT` on your query? To test you query before running everything out of it!

```sql
SELECT *
FROM {table_name}
LIMIT 10
```

As its name state, LIMIT allow you to limit the number of the results from you query! It is particularly good to use that to test your query of big tables.

> this `LIMIT` could be the equivalent of `head` or `tail` if your are R or Python user

## A tip for SEO with a search and replace

This tips might help you if you are using Wordpress and/or if you are an SEO: a search and replace for every URLs in our database.

```sql
UPDATE `wpecuXX_posts` 
SET guid = REPLACE(guid, 'http://www.domaine.tdl/', 'https://www.domaine.tdl/') 
WHERE `guid` LIKE 'https://www.domaine.tdl/%';
```

> Note that this example could work if you are doing a migration (other than https > https), or moving from staging to production (easy to verify you didn't miss a link for example).

In this case, I am only taking care of absolute URL. But let's say that for SEO purpose, I recommend you to use relative URLs in your pages, posts, ... for Interlinking purposes.
