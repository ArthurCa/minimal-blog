Finding weird stuff on the Internet is not a new thing, but here I am only talking about weird SEO stuff while doing it's (SEO) work. This is what this article is about, the FWS!

## What is SEO FWS (Finding Weird Stuff)?

Finding Weird Stuff is a type of SEO that focuses on finding unusual or interesting content that is not easily found through a simple search engine query. This type of content can be found in many places, including online forums, social media sites, and other websites that are not well-known. Finding Weird Stuff can be a great way to stand out from the crowd and attract attention to your website or blog. 

> Note: FWS is part -- for me -- of the work of a [Technical SEO Specialist](/tech-seo-what-is-it)

## Disclaimer

As an SEO -- Like in many other fields and craft -- you may find weird stuff while doing your work! This article is not intended to point fingers at people, company or even ways of doing work; It's just a fun way to share personnal examples or things I could have seen online (Twitter mostly).

## Where to find weird SEO stuff?

For me there are 2 places where you can find weird SEO stuff: 

- On the current live version of the website
- On previous versions of the website

### Finding Weird Stuff on the current website

Sometimes, just by browsing the website, you may stumble upon some strange or weird stuff: aka things that should not be there or pages that should not behave that way.

### Finding Weird Stuff on "old" version of the website

If the changes were quite recent, you can use the Google cache (yes before Googlebot comes back to the page); if the changes are from several weeks or months (or years?), I recommend you to use the archive.org website -- Yes the Wayback Machine ;-)
