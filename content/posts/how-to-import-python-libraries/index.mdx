First you will have to verify if the library/the package is installed on you environement (or your machine or server).

_Note: you might found different terminologies for libraries, it could also be called packages or modules._

This import will work if you are using any version of Python (meaning Python 2 or Python 3).

## How to import a library 

To import a library, you will have to use `import` + `{the name of your library}`
So you could do this to import libraries one by one:

```python
import library1 
import library2
import library3
import library4 
```

Or you could use `import` and split libraries with a comma on the same line.

```python
import library1, library2, library3, library4
```

## import libraries as aliases

Sometime and to simplify your code and how you will call some python fuction, you will be able to define some aliases for your libraries. It works that way: `import` + `{the name of your library}` + `as` + `{alias}`

Let's take a generic example (and we will see some examples below):

```python
import library1 as lib1
```

_Note: you can definitely use any alias to call later a library on your scripts ... but there are some conventions._

## How to import famous libraries in Python

Let's see together some example of "famous" libraries and how to import them.

### Import pandas

```python
import pandas as pd
```

`pd` is usually the alias of `pandas`, this is one of the convention.

### Import numpy

```python
import numpy as np
```

The convention for `numpy` is to use `np` as an alias.

### Import re 

```python
import re
```

Here there is not need to use an alias because `re` is only two letters and that is short enough.

### Import json

```python
import json
```

No alias in this example.
