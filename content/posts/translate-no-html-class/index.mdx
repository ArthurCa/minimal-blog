Based on a tweet (yes again), I wanted to show you a good tip about HTML and internalization. This is also something useful for SEO, especially when you need/want internationalization for your content.

## The main usecase

The main usecase I would know for this no translate HTML code would be for you brand name and your baseline. That way they will always stay as your created them.

## Another usecase

Another usecase for me would be your name, expecially where some people have common first or last name. OR even when your name could mean something else in another language.
