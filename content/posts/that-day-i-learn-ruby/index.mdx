Don't get me wrong, I don't have the pretention to know Ruby or how to code in Ruby. It's just a way of saying that "if you want to do something, just do it!"

## Let me tell you a story about Ruby

One day, we had one of our Hackhathon at my current company & we werw short on dev support for an idea I had; so I said to myself "why not try to build something that I could connect to our exisiting tool".

The goald was to connect our website and search for some way to optimize our Interlinking strategy. I will not go into to much details about the how and what of this tool (internal knowledge guys ðŸ˜‡); But I will explain my journey into Ruby.

> Interlinking: the process of linking 2 pages on the same property/website. The end goal is to help crawler discover these pages and enhance the visibility (and the Organic ranks) of a specific page.

## First step: What is Ruby?

I heard of Ruby in the past, but that was really blurry for me. So the first thing I did is using a search engine and find official website and good articles about this language. Following that, the second step was to search on our internal documentation for coursese, tutorials, ...

I found great learning tool thanks to CodecAemy (in addition to path available for employee at Shopify). Let me share with you some of the courses I took and the thing I learned!

## Learning Ruby: the courses 101, 102 and 103

The goal of these introduction courses were to understand the structure of the language and how variables are working

### Learning Ruby 101

### Learning Ruby 102

### Learning Ruby 103

## So in the end: what about Ruby?

In the end I was able to learn and understand Ruby ... but not build a tool in 2-3 days (obviously). It was great, I am feeling more comfortable understanding and making changes to our website (yeah part of the [Technical SEO](/tech-seo-what-is-it) priviledge is to modify Tech stuff ðŸ˜…).

And in the end I used Python and Streamlit to build the app I had in mind: I am more familiar with [Python](/tags/python) and thanks to [SQL](/tags/sql) I was able to connect this tool with our exisitng ones.

## Want to hop on the train?

If you want to hop on the Ruby train: let's hit the Rails! You can follow the same introduction course I took on CodecAdemy, you could go to Udemy or go to Coursera or even RubyMonk (I will not list everywebsite available). There is a ton of ressources online to learn Ruby, including the one from the Ruby Foundation!
