I'm currently reading a really nice book "Mastering Software Development in R" — but also a complete book — about R language. It was written by Roger D. Peng, Sean Kross and Brooke Anderson

## Mastering Software Development in R

In the introduction of this book, authors give you an insight for all the packages they will use — and also invite you to install them — If you familiar with R, it will be no big deal ;-) And maybe a lot of theses packages are already installed on you R — ... but familiar or not I will give you some advice to be more efficient, because that's 45 packages.

Because time is what we are looking for with software like R: automation of data analyses to get more time of "real consulting" !

## Installing packages with R

If you know just a little of R you could try :

```r
install.packages("package_name")
```

But really 45 times, are you insane ? ;-)

If you just have to install a few packages, you could try to install several — dependents — packages in one : 
```r
install.packages("package_name")
```

## Onliner to install packages with R

But what I recommend you to do is to install all packages at once, with this line (example) :

```r
install.packages(c("package_one", "package_two", "...", "package_n"))
```

Note: it could take time ... time that you could use to comment this article and take a coffee/a tea!

### All the packages

And with all the packages :

```r
install.packages(c("choroplethr", "choroplethrMaps", "data.table", "datasets", "devtools", "dlnm", "dplyr", "faraway", "forcats", "GGally", "ggmap", "ggplot2", "ggthemes", "ghit", "GISTools", "grid", "gridExtra", "httr", "knitr", "leaflet", "lubridate", "magrittr", "methods", "microbenchmark", "package", "pander", "plotly", "profvis", "pryr", "purrr", "rappdirs", "raster", "RColorBrewer", "readr", "rmarkdown", "sp", "stats", "stringr", "testthat", "tidyr", "tidyverse", "tigris", "titanic", "viridis"))
```

## With a variable

You could also create a variable including all packages, like that :

```r
packages <- c("choroplethr", "choroplethrMaps", "data.table", "datasets", "devtools", "dlnm", "dplyr", "faraway", "forcats", "GGally", "ggmap", "ggplot2", "ggthemes", "ghit", "GISTools", "grid", "gridExtra", "httr", "knitr", "leaflet", "lubridate", "magrittr", "methods", "microbenchmark", "package", "pander", "plotly", "profvis", "pryr", "purrr", "rappdirs", "raster", "RColorBrewer", "readr", "rmarkdown", "sp", "stats", "stringr", "testthat", "tidyr", "tidyverse", "tigris", "titanic", "viridis")
```

And then call them directly on a variable ;-)

## Listing all the packages from "Mastering Software Development in R"

The list of all the packages are :

* choroplethr
* choroplethr
* Maps
* data.table
* datasets
* devtools
* dlnm
* dplyr
* faraway
* forcats
* GGally
* ggmap
* ggplot2
* ggthemes
* ghit
* GISTools
* grid
* gridExtra
* httr
* knitr
* leaflet
* lubridate
* magrittr
* methods
* microbenchmark
* package
* pander
* plotly
* profvis
* pryr
* purrr
* rappdirs
* raster
* RColorBrewer
* readr
* rmarkdown
* sp
* stats
* stringr
* testthat
* tidyr
* tidyverse
* tigris
* titanic
* viridis

If you've understand how it works, it would be the same to call several libraries :

```r
library(c("choroplethr", "choroplethrMaps", "data.table", "datasets", "devtools", "dlnm", "dplyr", "faraway", "forcats", "GGally", "ggmap", "ggplot2", "ggthemes", "ghit", "GISTools", "grid", "gridExtra", "httr", "knitr", "leaflet", "lubridate", "magrittr", "methods", "microbenchmark", "package", "pander", "plotly", "profvis", "pryr", "purrr", "rappdirs", "raster", "RColorBrewer", "readr", "rmarkdown", "sp", "stats", "stringr", "testthat", "tidyr", "tidyverse", "tigris", "titanic", "viridis"))
```
