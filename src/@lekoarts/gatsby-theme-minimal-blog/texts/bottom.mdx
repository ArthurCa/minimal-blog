## Find me on the Internet

I work on several projects like Fixie Lille (Fr), a website about bikes which brings together bike lovers around the world.

I've also wrote on several french marketing and tech blogs around the years: Webzeen, Open Linking, Antispam, etc.

For french speaking people, you can find me on [Merci Sergey - SEO tech and Data](https://www.mercisergey.com/) -  and for english speaking folks, This woould be the place to hangout where I talk about SEO, automation, Python, R and Internet stuff ;-)
