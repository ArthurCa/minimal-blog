Nowadays, my job title is Sr. SEO Manager @ Shopify. I am specialized in technical SEO and automation. What does that mean? It means that part of my Technical SEO day-to-day involves the process of "tweaking" our website to help search engines being more efficientl at crawling and indexing it.

During my free time I like to play with SEO, Data, CMS and a lot of web stuff ... but also I am a big cycling afficionados & a tea lover!
