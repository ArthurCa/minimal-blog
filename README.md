## Arthur's Blog on Gatsby

Welcome on my Github repo for my blog on [https://arthur.camberlein.com](https://arthur.camberlein.com). It's one of my project online and I wanted to test something different -- different than Wordpress for example -- for my website and blog (in English).

You could say that [This blog](https://arthur.camberlein.com/blog) is the equivalent of [Merci Sergey](https://www.mercisergey.com/) in English!

## What to find here?

On this repo, it's the code from my website:

* The homepage: [SEO and Data Specialist in Canada](https://arthur.camberlein.com)
* Some of my projects (still WIP): [Arthur on the web](https://arthur.camberlein.com/projects) but sorry you will not know everything ðŸ˜†
* The blog: [SEO, Python, SQL, Data, ... blog](https://arthur.camberlein.com/blog)
* The about section: [Who is Arthur Camberlein?](https://arthur.camberlein.com/about)

## More?

If your are looking for more ressources, you could get most of the code use in my articles directly in this github repo [https://github.com/ArthurCa/blog-en](https://github.com/ArthurCa/blog-en)

## Where does this come from?

I am using a theme made by [LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts), thank you to him! And I am using Gatsby as framework/CMS and hosting platform!
